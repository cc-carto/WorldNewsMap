"China started separating its economy from the West years ago (Nov 3, 2025)",39.9042,116.4074,"Summarises how the Chinese government has spent the last two decades detaching itself from the global trade market while increasing self-reliance on producing goods essential to the lives of the Chinese people. This has resulted in China having an upper hand over other countries such as the US in trade negotiations. At the same time, its push to achieve total independence has made itself the leading producers of various materials and goods, therefore giving them an advantage over others.

"China's Security State sells an A.I. Dream (Nov 4, 2025)",39,116,"Talks about how advancements in technology and A.I. is creating a Chinese state that is becoming more capable of monitoring its citizens through cell phones, social media etc. Companies have been putting forth various kinds of technology such as speech recognition, robots and big data analysis to understand people's movements, habits, patterns, contacts and more to generate a holistic profile of each person. The key advantage to all this is how big the Chinese market is, given how much access the government has to data of its people. The companies that cooperate with the government tend to also succeed in the commercial market in the future.

"Nigeria rejects Christian Genocide claims (Nov 4, 2025)",10,8,"Over 8000 civilians (Christian and Muslim) have been killed in 2025. There is currently no evidence of a particular religion being attacked more than the other but the country has been facing territorial conflicts between different groups of people, as well as terrorist attacks from Boko Haram in the NE, bandits in the NW, seccessionist conflicts in the SE and gunmen in the Middle Belt. The country is home to Africa's largest Christian population of more than 90 million. The country blames the US for breaking up its nationa, democracy and trying to turn it into a failed state. However, the government has done little to prevent this situation from worsening, where no accountability or consquences are made on the government officials responsible on such security failures. In addition, the violence is causing many farmers to abandon their land, thus hurting national economy.

"Tik Tok and Optimism: How Rob Jetten won over the Netherlands (Nov 4, 2025)",52.3676,4.9041,"Winning the election was the easy part for Jetten, but the hard part is to form a government/governing coalition. Jetten was able to oust his competitors for being young and optimistic, using the slogan 'It can be done' for his campaign. His positivity contrasted from his opponents and he is willing to engage with critics. In addition, his use of social media and television appearances boosted his public image. Jetten's party - D66 isn't a crazy leftist group, but rather it takes on a middle ground on issues such as immigration, therefore gaining more support from people who have a more centered stance on the political spectrum.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/world/europe/rob-jetten-dutch-elections.html?smid=url-share
"Canada is about to lose its status as having eliminated Measles (Nov 6, 2025)",53.5462,-113.4937,"Measles have began reappearing in Canada in 2024 and it has been spreading across the nation due to falling vaccination rates and increased skepticism of public health messaging. This year, the country has recorded more than 5000 cases, with the province of Alberta racking in nearly 2000 cases. Politics is playing a part in this outbreak with politicians stopping public health officials from raising awareness on the issue and the importance of vaccinations. With this going on, Canada may be the first Western country to lose its measles elimination status from the WHO. Childhood vaccination rates for measles have fallen and there is deep mistrust of public health and its institutions. However, we are seeing some improvements where since March, 130,000 measles vaccines have been administered across Alberta - a 50% increase compared to the previous year.

"As Saudi cracks down on drugs, execution near a record high (Nov 7, 2025)",24.7136,46.6753,"Saudi Arabia is waging a war on drugs, sending death penalties to those who smuggle drugs like amphetamine into the kingdom. As of this year so far, there have already been 320 executions, which is far higher than the number from previous years. The nation justifies for such death penalties because drug smuggling is akin to a violent attack in their religion. However, human rights groups argue that these punishments are also being used on low income foreigners who were coerced into carrying drugs. They state that the Kingdom is targeting the most vulnerable people (foreign nationals, trafficking victims), who have no power or knowledge of the situation they are in. The convicted state that they are forced into confessing and signing documents that aren't factual. Saudi Arabia has no written penal code, thus the penalties imposed on these drug smugglers entirely depend on the judge or whoever makes final decisions. There has been a rise in drug addiction in the nation, with the most commonly used substance being Captagon.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-executions-war-on-drugs.html?smid=url-share

"Jamaicans have been turning to Solar power. It paid off after the storm (Nov 8, 2025)",18.2944,-78.1564,"Solar panels have been gaining popularity in Jamaica, with many electing to set them up on the roofs of their homes. Following the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, those who have gone forth with this technology basically did not lose access to electricity. The solar market is still relatively small but its benefits in a hurricane prone region has showed its resilience to the people such that solar and other forms of renewable energy made up 10% of Jamaica's energy generation in 2023. They hope that with a growing solar interest, the country can cut down its reliance on imported fossils, as well as the use of refineries, power plants and transmission lines which are also subject to the impacts of climate change. In addition, with an influx of Chinese solar panels and the Jamaican government providing solar income-tax credit, the idea of owning solar became more attractive. On top of that, Jamaica's electric utility companies would compensate solar households for excess electricity that they put back into the grid. Another upside to solar is its ability to help homeowners save money on electricity bills. Carribean island nations (Jamaica alike) are asking for financial assistence from richer nations to fight against climate change.

"As aquifers dry up, Tehran rations water and calls for rain prayers (Nov 9, 2025)",35.7219,51.3347,"Iran is currently facing its worst drought in 6 decades, with government officials warning that the capital may need to be evacuated if the situation persists for another month, as they scramble to ration water for the city. In fact, major dams that feed Tehran are at critically low levels (around 5% capacity). To conserve water use, the city would lower its water pressure during the night to prevent urban leakage and allow reservoirs to refill. The drought has been so bad that Iranians have turned to conspiracy theories about neighboring countries stealing their rain clouds, diverting them away from their nation. Iranians also fear that there will be further water cuts in the near future. The Ministry of Energy has announced its plans to use cloud seeding techniques to encourage rainfall but for this to work, clouds must have at least 50% moisture, which isn't the case right now in Iran. On top of that, the country's water problems are a result of mismanagement, excessive dam construction, illegal well drilling and unsustainable agriculture, with climate change exacerbating the effects. Also, excessive groundwater extraction in Tehran has caused the ground to sink 300mm per year. The solution to all this is to modernize water consumption practices in agriculture, use A,I, and remote sensing to develop better water practices.

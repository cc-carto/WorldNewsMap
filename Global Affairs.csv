Tik Tok and Optimism: How Rob Jetten won over the Netherlands,52.3676,4.9041,"Winning the election was the easy part for Jetten, but the hard part is to form a government/governing coalition.

Canada is about to lose its status as having eliminated Measles,53.5462,-113.4937,"Measles have began reappearing in Canada in 2024 and it has been spreading across the nation due to falling vaccination rates and increased skepticism of public health messaging. This year, the country has recorded more than 5000 cases, with the province of Alberta racking in nearly 2000 cases. Politics is playing a part in this outbreak with politicians stopping public health officials from raising awareness on the issue and the importance of vaccinations. With this going on, Canada may be the first Western country to lose its measles elimination status from the WHO. Childhood vaccination rates for measles have fallen and there is deep mistrust of public health and its institutions. However, we are seeing some improvements where since March, 130,000 measles vaccines have been administered across Alberta - a 50% increase compared to the previous year.
